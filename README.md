Reddit Pane
===========

Reddit Pane is a (poorly written) web application for viewing [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) in a split pane view.

What it does
------------
Grabs reddit.com/r/funny.json and formats it into a pretty(ish) dual-pane view.

Why does this, precious
-----------------------
Because Emilie prefers reading her reddits like this.

Installation
------------
lol just clone it into a directory cmon son.

Things that should probably be done.
------------------------------------
+ Cache the JSON requests or something.
+ Select a particular reddit to view via dropdown or search box.

Props
-----
+ Reddit I suppose.
+ [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), because every app ever uses it now.
+ Actual JavaScript developers. I'm really sorry about this thing.
